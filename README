UDtools is a suite of CLI tools that allows access to drives and block devices,
as seen by UDisks (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/udisks). Currently,
UDtools comprises an enumerator and a set of shell functions that provide
context-aware, semantically correct autocompletion for
mount/umount/fdisk/fsck/mkfs and friends.

COMPATIBILITY
=============

UDtools has been tested on the following OS/Platform combinations:
* Linux (Arch Linux) / x64

DEPENDENCIES
============

UDtools has dependencies against:

	glib-2.0
	gobject-2.0
	gthread-2.0

        CMake	-	CMake is only required for building UDtools
	Bash	-	The autocompletion functions are written for Bash 4.x

UDtools expects to find UDisks 2 listening on the DBus system bus.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==================

UDtools uses CMake for source configuration and Makefile generation.
Assuming the UDtools source files have been extracted in a directory named
'udtools_source' relative to the current working directory, UDtools can be built
by doing:
---
$ mkdir udtools_staging
$ cd udtools_staging
$ cmake ../udtools_source

$ make install
---

Do note that depending on your system, you may have to run 'gmake' instead of
'make', as the Makefiles generated by CMake may not play nice with non-GNU
implementations of make.

The default install prefix for UDtools is /usr/local. This can be overriden by
passing '-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/my/install/prefix' to cmake during the
source configuration step.

RUNNING UDtools
===============

You'll need to source udcomplete.sh in your interactive shell. This is
accomplished by runnning '. /usr/local/lib/udcomplete.sh' either interactively
or by inserting the line in your ~/.bash_profile.

ROADMAP
=======

* UDpart	-	Manipulate partition tables from the CLI
* UDeject	-	Eject drives, not block devices
* UDisks 1 support (?)
