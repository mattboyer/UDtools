COMPATIBILITY
=============

UDtools has been tested on the following OS/Platform combinations:
* Linux (Arch Linux) / x64

DEPENDENCIES
============

UDtools has dependencies against:

	glib-2.0
	gobject-2.0
	gthread-2.0

        CMake   - CMake is only required for building UDtools

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==================

UDtools uses CMake for source configuration and Makefile generation.
Assuming the UDtools source files have been extracted in a directory named
'udtools_source' relative to the current working directory, UDtools can be built by
doing:
---
$ mkdir udtools_staging
$ cd udtools_staging
$ cmake ../udtools_source

$ make
---

Do note that depending on your system, you may have to run 'gmake' instead of
'make', as the Makefiles generated by CMake may not play nice with non-GNU
implementations of make.
